# Blob Maker

We begin life as blobs —
fluid and curious,
boundaries undefined, shapes unformed.

But slowly our edges become rigid, lines drawn by judgment, by fear, by rules
we never asked for.

We are told to remain static,
to stay within the lines.

Blob Maker
is a gift to the child
I once was—
and perhaps to the child within you.

A thank-you
to the creative coding community,
who in my darkest times,
offered me kindness.

You reminded me
it was okay
to be fluid,
and to explore without judgment

You saved me.
***

**May Blob Maker inspire you
to push gently at your own edges,
to wobble,
and to find freedom
in the joyful,
judgment-free dance
of becoming.**
